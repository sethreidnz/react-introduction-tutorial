# React Introduction

This project is a companion repository for my [Introduction To React Tutorial](https://github.com/justsayno/react-introduction-tutorial) showing the basics of using 
react as a view layer in a web application. It was generatedusing [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) the officially supported starter
from the React team.

There are a few steps you need to get up and running first.

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 4 (I recomend using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) on `nix systems or [Node Version Manager for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows))

Clone the repo and install the dependencies dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/justsayno/react-introduction

npm install
```

```
npm run static
```

```
npm run start
```
