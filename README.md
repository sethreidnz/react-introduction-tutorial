# Introduction to React

This repository has been created as an introduction to the main features of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) 
and [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router). It was created using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This tutorial has a git companion git repository with the code I am explaining. 
You can find the setup instructions in the [README here](https://github.com/justsayno/react-introduction).

Although not required you can follow the code changes made in each step on your local machine by cloning the repository and switching between the different 
branches that correspond to the steps in the tutorial. For example to go to the beginning run the following in a command window:

``` shell
git checkout step-0
```

Each step of the tutorial will have the git command that you need to see the code for that step.
